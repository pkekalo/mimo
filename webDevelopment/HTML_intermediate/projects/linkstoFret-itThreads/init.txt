Let's practice our knowledge of linking to local webpages by working on a popular social platform called Fret-it.

The site already has four webpages with content in them: index.html, aliens.html, e-tea.html, and ufo.html, but no links to them.

We'll add an unordered list of links inside index.html so that users can navigate to other pages from the homepage.
